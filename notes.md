> Entropy Formula\
> L = Password Length; Number of symbols in the password\
>
> S = Size of the pool of unique possible symbols (character set).\
>
> For example:\
>
> Numbers (0-9): 10\
> Lower Case Latin Alphabet (a-z): 26\
> Lower Case & Upper Case Latin Alphabet (a-z, A-Z): 52\
> ASCII Printable Character Set (a-z, A-Z, symbols, space): 95\
> Number of Possible Combinations = SL\
>
> Entropy = log2(Number of Possible Combinations)
